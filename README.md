# Third Part of Our Project - RECIPES WEB


By this project we ([`Yuval Cohen`](https://github.com/yuval5210), [`Noa Magrisso`](https://github.com/NoaMagrisso)) implemented a Recipes Website, as we asked to do under the "Internet Programming Environments" course at BGU.

* This project relates the Server Programming side, the API which they agree about it, and the last part as we did at the end of the project - the Clieng Programming side.
* The project includes few types of files - JavaScript, and Vue.js (which has parts of HTML and CSS). 
* Our website URL: https://foodYN.cs.bgu.ac.il

### You can see any recipe with it's properties, and if you save it as a "favorite" recipe, you can see it in your favorites list.
#### In addition, you can see your recipes and your family recipes.
